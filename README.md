A BASIC Tale: A Choose Your Own Adventure

How to access story:
The story can be found on the Apple IIe in MITH. Insert the DOS 3.3 Disk and enter the phrase "RUN CATDSTORY". Begin playthrough.

Group Members and Responsbilities:

Our group is composed of Chen, Andy, Trent, and Dan.

Communications (e-mail, Google Docs, logistics): Trent started an email chain to start the project, and Andy made a Google Doc to share our code (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DV1LJrkT2HNy00Sbkd6_RTKEPw-n-Jv0RnIuoJyfZNk/edit?usp=sharing).
Story planning (story boarding, writing): Everyone
Learn BASIC: We all learned to code on our own, but Dan and Chen researched guides for us to use. In the proess of developing the story and debugging, we combined our knowledge to solve problem code and figure out different ways of coding lines.
Coding (including editing of code): Everyone, but Dan started us off with a test program (CATD)
Testing: Everyone

Statement:

One of the main ideas that informed our story was the conversations in the class about the idea of blackboxing. We hoped to, at least to some extent, make the program transparent to the reader. Our group had two discussions regarding the medium that we wanted to present this defamiliarized program in.  Hypercard and BASIC were the two most logical conclusions for what we ultimately wanted to do.  BASIC was appealing to us, as it would require us to type the actual code behind the entire program.  This led to us pursuing the idea of making a BASIC program about making a BASIC program. We wanted to make the user aware of how the program functioned, so we planned a segment of the story to involve learning how to code in BASIC. While we could not teach all of BASIC, we were able to get to most of the essential elements (PRINT, conditionals, variables, inputs). 

Another inspiration for our project was the “Choose Your Own Adventure” series.  We wanted to build the BASIC tutorial within a larger story of writing a BASIC program, which contained multiple “nodes.” Even if the user did not pick the “right” choice, we wanted the story to continue proceeding.  As a result, our program has multiple forks that the user can follow.  Each story line eventually “ends” but leads back to a set of code which provides the user with the option to play again.

For the most part, we worked collaboratively, finding times to meet at MITH. Our first meeting focused on deciding what program to use for the coding and the overarching idea behind our story.  We took the first weekend to explore online tutorials and user manuals. We came up with the concept together, storyboarded together, and took an afternoon to go through BASIC code as a team.  Since no members of the team had experience with coding in BASIC, we utilized the user manuals and online tutorials to figure out how to program.  We then created a temporary file, titled CATD, so that we could try various string and integer functions, IF/THEN, GOTO, END and other code functions.  We broke up the story branches into quarters, and each person took responsibility for deciding the particular details.  The lines of code were broken into the following segments: Dan took lines 50-193, Andy developed lines 600-807/1200-1296, Trent developed lines 808-1161, and Chen developed lines 1300-1394.  After completing our individual lines of code, we came back together as a group to run the program multiple times and debug.  We were able to catch several errors as a team, and it was valuable to bring all of our experiences together to eliminate bad code.    

Throughout the whole process we took pictures and draw sketches in order to make sure we won't lose anything, to make our ideas clear to us, and to make our communication easier (for example we numbered the stages of the story used the numbers to indicate which part each one of us is responsible for coding).
